# Eye-Tracker
Description: This includes two eyes. The eye ball in each of the eye move together in the direction in which the mouse is moved.

Execution: To run this project, move the index.html file to any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with the positioning of the eyes and also change the background colors and the size of the eyes and the eye balls.

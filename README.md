# Eye-Tracker
Description: This includes two eyes. The eye balls in each eye move together in the direction in which the mouse is moved.

How to Run: To run this project, open the index.html file in any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with the positioning of the eyes and also change the background colors and the size of the eyes and the eye balls.
